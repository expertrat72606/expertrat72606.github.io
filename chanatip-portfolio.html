            </p>
            <p>
                I chose Digital Media Engineering because I love the combination of creativity
                and technology. My goal is to become a game developer and eventually start my
                own game studio focused on creating immersive experiences that blend storytelling

                <h3>Learning Game Development: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p><time datetime="2025-01-15">January 15, 2025</time></p>
                <p>
                    Game development has been one of the most exciting yet challenging parts of my journey as a Unity
                    developer. During my
                    internship at Varisoft, I was introduced to real-world development tasks, which pushed me to grow
                    quickly. At first, I
                    was assigned to a large multiplayer project, but due to its complexity, I was given the chance to
                    create my own
                    hyper-casual games instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on some games taught me a lot—from writing clean, organized code to designing fun gameplay
                    mechanics. One of my biggest challenges was learning new systems from scratch and structuring my
                    scripts in a way that
                    made them scalable and reusable. With guidance from senior developers and lots of trial and error, I
                    started to
                    understand best practices and improve my workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience showed me that game development is a mix of creativity and problem-solving. The key
                    is to keep learning,
                    stay curious, and not be afraid to ask for help when you’re stuck. Every challenge I faced helped me
                    become a better
                    developer, and I’m excited to keep building and improving from here.
